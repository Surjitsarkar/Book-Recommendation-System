# Book-Recommendation-System

In this type of recommendation sytem, we will be using the Collaborative Filtering.

Our main focus will be, to use the Machine Learning Algorithms i.e: K - Nearest Neighbour(K-NN) with using Cosine Similarity.
We will also use the Features Pivot Matrix, to know the ratings scenario with books read by user.
